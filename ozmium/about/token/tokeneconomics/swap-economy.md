# Swap Economy

### Transactions & Utility Use

OZ functions as system credit, like arcade tokens, powering in-game content, AI-driven events, true random seeds, special campaign NPCs, and world-state changes in Oz clients.

* **Open Swaps:** Anyone can swap Ozmium and related assets on the open market. The Uniswap pool generates a fee that helps power the treasury and helps the Ozmium ecosystem in return.
* **Discount Cycles:** Market-driven discounts let players and agents buy OZ credits even programmatically when prices are low, then redeem value through gameplay or trade later.
* **Buyback Cycles:** Project-initiated buybacks replenish in-game inventory or incentivize gameplay, supporting a fair, open, and organic economy.
