# Airdrops & Staking

### Staking & Rewards

* **An Official Vault** for public decentralized OZ staking will be deployed later, letting anyone stake OZ for game rewards, credits, or access to other vault exclusive features.
* **Airdrops** will be the primary form of reward distribution for vault stakers and active users.
* **Burn Penalty:** Early withdrawal from vaults may incur burn penalties to deter abuse.

Staking functions like a loyalty points savings pool you earn from while not using your Ozmium tokens. We know campaign games can be seasonal especially if competitive and organized, or maybe there's a group effort underway for a bigger idea- regardless, the idea of staking provides free credit whenever you hit pause on using those credits for a while. This also helps keep the token economy stabilized and give you options about the things that are important most to you in the game clients that rely on your decision-making power.
