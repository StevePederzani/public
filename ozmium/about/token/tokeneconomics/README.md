# Token Economy & Treasury Strategy

## Thesis Statement

<mark style="color:purple;">**A well-developed economic GameFi model can sustain a self-reinforcing treasury delivering competitive yields compared to network-level staking rewards while facilitating on-chain growth.**</mark>

The Ozmium ecosystem is engineered to deliver an on-chain game economy and rewards loop that can rival or surpass traditional staking yields, always to the benefit of the underlying Base and Ethereum networks. Ozmium operates with a Base-forward focus. A successful project will showcase the builder economy where contributions become as valuable as running a node in decentralization. Engaging in Ozmium powers content and community, and this value is directly reflected in the token’s market cap. This is the basis of inherent value behind GameFi and core to Ozmium development principles.&#x20;

## Treasury Strategy & Proprietary Algorithm

Every swap incurs a 0.8% ecosystem fee, split for maximum ecosystem value:

* **USDC:** Stable yield (e.g., 4.1% APY via Coinbase rewards.)
* **ETH:** Strategic buys, cbETH stacking, and liquidity maintenance.
* **OZ:** Redistribution for player rewards, loot, and OZ staking airdrops.

A multisig treasury wallet is separated from hot project funds, optimizing self-sufficiency and enabling future smart-yield via a trinary (USDC/ETH/OZ) strategy and smart wallet agent integrations.

Ozmium’s “golden egg," however, is Ozwald — a Coinbase ecosystem specialized trading algorithm developed by ozmium.eth to maintain this trinary balance. Think of it as revolving “token flow,” managing cash flow like a short-window, small-volume loan fund or certificate of deposit, but entirely on-chain. Ozwald’s engine uses real-time high-frequency market data and an exhaustive suite of technical analysis tools (Panda TA and proprietary functions) for an on-chain augmented treasury.

With a nearly 60% win rate in over 50,000 transactions and even higher for select sentiment bins, the project treasury is poised to have a strong foundation for capitalization on a low volume budget over time from well-planned financial and asset strategy. A minority of treasury funds will be maintained algorithmically, with the majority balanced between USDC, ETH, and cbETH for native yield.

Although Ozwald's algorithm itself is proprietary, as project earnings grow, Ozwald will be polished, scaled, maintained, and websocket streaming of asset ratings made available using Ozmium tokens.&#x20;

Below is an example JSON results record of a 12-hour predictive algorithm test session of Ozwald showing accuracy levels depending on configurations that can exceed statistical arbitrage and even proprietary levels of algorithmic exchange further making Coinbase and the Base ecosystem the best products for overall treasury solutions for GameFi, DeFi, and Project Tokens as well with this system.
