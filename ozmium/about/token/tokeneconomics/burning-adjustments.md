# Burning Adjustments

### Fixed Supply & Token Burning

Burning decreases supply to help preserve balance during slow demand. Token burning may be conducted manually or programmatically adjust supply, reward long-term holders, or support compliance-driven scenarios for ecosystem benefit. Burning may be done through incentives like changing the cost of goods to burn tokens rather than receive them as payment, burning a portion of swap fees accrued, or (not preferred) by increasing the burn penalty of early unstaking where applicable in staking contracts.

**Potential reasons for burning include:**

* Mitigating excess supply after promotional campaigns.
* Counteracting economic shocks or exploit mitigation.
* Rewarding long-term or loyal holders.
* Legal or compliance-advantaged treasury reduction.
