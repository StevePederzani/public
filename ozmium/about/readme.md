# Important Disclaimers

{% hint style="warning" %}
This **whitepaper** or **concept paper** is a **living document**, meaning it can change at any time without notice. It shows the current plans and ideas of the project, but is not a guarantee or promise. The information here, including projections, product details, and financial models, is for informational purposes only and not given as financial advice or an invitation to invest. The project may update, remove, or change content based on existing or future changes in law, technology, and ethics. Investors and readers: do your own research, and check regularly for changes.

1.  **General Legal Disclaimer**

    > This concept or “whitepaper” outlines a utility token and its ecosystem role for informational purposes only. It is not legal, financial, tax, or investment advice, nor an offer to buy, sell, or promote securities or financial instruments. Built on a Base network smart contract, the token is usable for play system governance, onchain transacting, and service access within the application(s). It is not an investment, promises no future value, and grants no ownership, dividends, profits, or financial returns. Its use is purely operational, forming no fiduciary, contractual, or agency relationship with the project. The token is not redeemable through the project for fiat currency. Information may change without notice, and forward-looking statements about plans or goals carry no update obligation as conditions shift. Digital asset regulations evolve, so users must ensure local law compliance, as we cannot define the token’s status across all jurisdictions. Engagement involves risks. Market volatility, regulatory changes, smart contract issues, and project delays, which everyone accepts at their discretion. Risks like regulatory shifts, funding delays, or program changes remain, yet we bear no responsibility for resulting losses. Investing in ERC20 tokens carries the risk of loss of principal; there is a possibility of decline in any prescribed value of which you might not recover your initial investment amount. This risk is inherent in the Ethereum and Base ecosystems, including global financial markets, and can be influenced by various factors, including market and network conditions, economic trends, and the financial performance of the underlying assets. Research independently before participating.
2.  **Tax Claiming for Capital Gains or Loss**

    > Participation in digital asset ecosystems such as Ozmium may have tax implications based on your jurisdiction. U.S. users can refer to Coinbase general guidance for information on crypto taxes, cost basis, and reporting responsibilities.

5.  **No Guarantee of Platform Continuity or Feature Set**

    > We do not guarantee the continued availability or functionality of the platform, its features, or services. The features and services provided by the project are subject to change, suspension, or discontinuation at the project's discretion without prior notice. This includes but is not limited to modifications, updates, or removals of any features, tools, or services offered within the ecosystem. While we strive to maintain the platform’s operational stability, users acknowledge and accept that the project is under continuous development and may evolve, with no assurance that specific features or services will remain available in the future.
6.  **Limitation of Liability and Disputes**

    > Any disputes arising from or relating to this agreement, the use of the token, or participation in the ecosystem shall be governed by U.S. and Nebraska law, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Such disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in Nebraska, with any arbitration award being final, binding, and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of Nebraska courts for any legal proceedings, including enforcement of arbitration awards. Neither party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages related to the use of the token or ecosystem. The project, affiliates, and partners disclaim all liability, to the fullest extent permitted by Nebraska law, for any losses, damages, or legal consequences resulting from token use or interaction with the ecosystem, including indirect harms. In no event shall the total liability of the project, affiliates, and partners exceed one (1) US dollar.
7.  **Third-Party Integration and Dependency Disclaimer**

    > This ecosystem may rely on third-party services (e.g., wallets, bridges, exchanges, etc.). We do not control, audit, or guarantee the availability, security, or functionality of these services and disclaim all liability for any disruptions, failures, or damages arising from their use. By engaging with third-party integrations, you do so at your own risk. The primary focus is on building within the Base, Coinbase, and Farcaster ecosystems.
8.  **Privacy Policy**&#x20;

    > Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, privacy is inherently tied to how transactions and interactions are recorded on the public ledger. We do not collect or store personal data unless explicitly necessary and stated; however, integrations in the source of libraries like SDKs may use data to deliver a customizable experience not for collection or resale. By interacting with the ecosystem, you acknowledge and accept that all transactions and activity on the blockchain are publicly visible and immutable and that interfaces must transact with various forms of your data to achieve your intended interactions.
9.  **Legal Compliance, Equal Opportunity, and Non-Discrimination Clause**

    > The project fully complies with and is committed to upholding all applicable U.S. federal and state laws, ensuring alignment with relevant standards and regulations. We adhere to principles of fairness and non-discrimination, prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability, or age, in accordance with Title VI, Title VII, Section 504, and other related laws. We are dedicated to promoting Equal Opportunity in all practices and contracting, as outlined by Executive Order 11246. Furthermore, all funding and lending opportunities will meet the requirements of applicable local, state, and federal laws.
