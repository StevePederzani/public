# Regulatory Commitment

| Regulatory Concern                      | Ozmium's Commitment / Compliance Position                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SEC / Securities (Howey Test)**       | $OZ is strictly a utility token—**no shares, equity, dividends, profit expectation, investment contracts, or treasury/dev allocation.** Entire supply issued publicly.               |
| **CFTC / Commodity Classification**     | No derivatives, futures, options, or speculative contracts. All trades via permissionless DEX; no centralized commodity trading or proprietary positions.                            |
| **FinCEN / MSB & Money Transmission**   | No fiat transactions, custody, asset redemption, or operator-held wallets. All token activities self/non-custodial; zero exposure to money transmission regulations.                 |
| **AML / KYC Compliance**                | Protocol is fully non-custodial. Users requiring AML/KYC compliance have verified wallet options through Base/Coinbase’s regulated onboarding systems.                               |
| **State Money Transmitter Licenses**    | No custody, redemption, or direct user asset transfer; project/operator does not hold or transmit user assets—DEX liquidity is 100% decentralized.                                   |
| **OFAC / Sanctions Compliance**         | Smart contracts immutable and permissionless. No centralized user restrictions or geofencing imposed; fully decentralized operation.                                                 |
| **Consumer Protection (UDAP)**          | Absolute transparency; clearly communicated risks and token status. No investment solicitation or deceptive marketing; fully disclosed, open licensing model.                        |
| **Stablecoin / Banking Regulation**     | $OZ is **not a stablecoin**, unpegged from fiat, and non-redeemable. No custodial redemption service or financial instrument status.                                                 |
| **Tax Reporting**                       | No processing/reporting of user tax obligations; all tax responsibilities remain entirely with and at holders individual discretion.                                                 |
| **Treasury & Dev Centralization Risks** | No dev vault—100% token supply publicly allocated via liquidity pools. No centralized entity holding supply or controlling issuance.                                                 |
| **Rug Pull / Admin Risk Mitigation**    | Contracts immutable, control fully renounced, LP permanently locked (via Clanker). No upgradeability, admin privileges, or backdoors.                                                |
| **Intellectual Property Rights**        | Ozmium content is dual-licensed under **CC-BY-SA**. Trademark (logo/name) and proprietary algorithm rights clearly reserved; usage terms and fair-use parameters explicitly defined. |

## DAO & Governance Clarification

Ozmium is deployed via the **Clanker v0.3.1** smart contract deployer. It does not inherently include governance or DAO functionalities. Independent governance structures may freely adopt and utilize $OZ via separate smart contracts.&#x20;

**$OZ tokens do not confer shares, voting rights, equity, or corporate governance.**

{% hint style="success" %}
All compliance aspects transparently disclosed. No centralized issuer, custodial risk, sanctions, investment solicitation, or financial instrument designation applies to Ozmium ($OZ).
